A platformer video game project completed as part of the course Game Programming
-  
Klofalaekjarkjaftur is small, green and nothing distinguishes her from the other residents of her village, whom she has known since she was little. Her village is practically the only place Klofalaekjarkjaftur knows — the next village is a several days' journey away and the forest is full of dangers. Her grandfather told her that his grandfather has once met a human in the forest — which him frightened so that he was never the same again. Humans are dangerous and it is because of them that ogres live in small communities deep in the forest. Years ago, human adventurers could travel between worlds to hunt ogres, among other creatures. To ensure the ogres' safety, magical gems that allowed such travels were hidden and ogres now stick to their safe villages. 

Klofalaekjarkjaftur has never wanted to leave her village or her family; after all, ogres stick together... until one day, when she found a man in the forest. The man didnt’t have big teeth, he was just strangely not very green and very unhappy. Klofalaekjarkjaftur promised to help him — after all, no one would want to find themselves alone in a foreign forest and for the only person who can help to turn away and leave. 

To help the man to return to his world, Klofalaekjarkjaftur and he must gather five magical gems. The gems are scattered around the forest near the ogre village. The forest is full of dangers, enemies and strangers, but along the way, the unusual main characters also encounter friendly figures who want to help them.
