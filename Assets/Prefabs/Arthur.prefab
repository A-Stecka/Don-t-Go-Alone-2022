  - Hello travellers! How are you? What are you doing here? Do you like my berry
    farm? Why are you out in the woods all alone?
  - Wow, slow down, how about one question at a time?
  - My name is Klofalaekjarkjaftur ^_^ And who are you?
  - "The name\u2019s Arthur. Hello little ogress. Your companion asked me to choose
    one question, so I\u2019ll start with the most important one \u2013 how do you
    like my berry farm?"
  - Choice
  - "It\u2019s lovely! I\u2019ve never seen berries like these before, what are they? "
  - "Oh! I\u2019m actually not sure. They were just here so I started watering them.
    I can\u2019t even eat berries, you know, no body and all. And, young fellow,
    what\u2019s your name?"
  - "I\u2019m John. I\u2019m not from here."
  - "Yes, young fellow, I\u2019ve noticed. There\u2019s one man who looks just like
    you here, but we do not speak of him."
  - What? Why?
  - " He\u2019s a nasty person, that\u2019s why. He shouldn\u2019t be here either.
    Just showed up one day. Some say he has a magic crystal and that\u2019s how he\u2019s
    here."
  - Do you know where we can find him?
  - "Some say he\u2019s further East. But it\u2019s a long, tiring way from here.
    I would much rather take care of my berries instead. I assume that\u2019s where
    you two are headed?"
  - "Yes sir. We\u2019re looking for the Five Great Crystals so Jacob can get home."
  - My name is John. But yes, we are looking for the Five Great Crystals.
  - "Let me treat you to some berries then, since you\u2019re both such nice fellows.
    They smell sweet and I\u2019m told they taste great too. Maybe if you see Janice
    she can tell you."
  - Thank you sir! Have a good day! Bye bye!
  - End
  - "Ugh, old man, we don\u2019t have time for this."
  - "That\u2019s not very nice, young fellow. You should know better than to be mean,
    with a face like that."
  - Excuse me?
  - "If you weren\u2019t with her, I\u2019d think you\u2019re the nasty wizard from
    further East. You look just like him. Young lady, why didn\u2019t you teach this
    creature any manners?"
  - "Hey! His name is James, not \u201Cthis creature\u201D."
  - "Um, it\u2019s actually John."
  - "Arthur, you\u2019re no one to teach us manners when you speak to him like that."
  - How about I treat you two to some of my berries? To clear the air?
  - That seems fair.
  - "Here you go\u2026 that should teach you some manners."
  - "Hey, Klofalaekjarkjaftur? I don\u2019t feel so well\u2026"
  - "If you\u2019re mean to someone don\u2019t expect them to give you something
    that isn\u2019t poison berries."
  - Live--
